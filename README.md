# FinalProject-1213
This project is code for a restaurant ordering system for a hypothetical restaurant.
It includes classes such as Appetizer, Main Course, Dessert.
The code will initially ask the user to input what part of the menu they would like to navigate to. This includes 1. View Menu, 2. Place Order, 3. Process Order, and 4. Exit.
Then, after selecting whichever path the user would like, the code then asks to input which menu item the user would like, such as Caesar Salad or Vanilla Ice Cream. It produces a statment letting the user know that the order has been placed. Next, the user must process the order, then exit.
